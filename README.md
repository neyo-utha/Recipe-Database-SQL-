# Recipe-Database-SQL-
This is a database of my favourite recipes. 
The database includes these fields for each recipe: name, a link for individual recipes, course classification (hor d'oeuvre, soup, appetizer, salad, main, or dessert), and primary ingredient in the recipe. Additionally there are fields for your comments and finally a field for a personal rating which you can update at your leisure. Please feel free to use this database of recipes, add to or take away from it and utilize the comments and ratings section to customize your recipes further. This project is very simple and creates a basic SQL database which can be used to retrieve recipe data. If you want to learn more about retrieving data please vist the site below. Enjoy! 

If you want to learn more about SQL and practice your knowledge www.sql-practice.com is a great resource.
